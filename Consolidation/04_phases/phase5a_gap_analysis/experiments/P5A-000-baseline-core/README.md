# P5A-000 — P5A-000-baseline-core

**Focus:** shared baseline: stage1 per-target ensemble + stage2 cross-property partner features + physics identity overlays

**Mechanism:** built on the shared core (exp_core.py): stage-1 per-target ensemble
(LGBM/XGB/ExtraTrees, grouped 5-fold OOF, best-by-OOF), stage-2 cross-property partner
features (exact train partner labels where the same SMILES has another property, else
stage-1 predictions), physics identity overlays (eps=nc^2+ionic, egb~egc, ei~egc+eea)
with alphas fitted on OOF only, final clip to train bounds.

**Experiment-specific config:** {}

**Gate:** floor baseline (no gate); every later experiment is compared against this and against incumbent V57 0.9024

**Run:** bash ../run.sh P5A-000   (or all: bash ../run.sh)
**Score:** frozen predictions are scored post-hoc against Oracle/final_oracle.csv by run.sh
(mean of 7 per-target R2; incumbent V57 = 0.9024; target 0.9350; est private = mean - 0.011).
